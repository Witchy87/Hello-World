entries.  You can improve your submission's chances of being included by
adding background information on user population and years of currency.
References to actual usage via URLs and/or Google pointers are particularly
welcomed.</a></p><p><a id="submitting-new-entries">All contributions and suggestions about the Jargon File will be
considered donations to be placed in the public domain as part of this File,
and may be used in subsequent paper editions.  Submissions may be edited for
accuracy, clarity and concision.</a></p><p><a id="submitting-new-entries">We are looking to expand the File's range of technical specialties
covered.  There are doubtless rich veins of jargon yet untapped in the
scientific computing, graphics, and networking hacker communities; also in
numerical analysis, computer architectures and VLSI design, language design,
and many other related fields.  Send us your jargon!</a></p><p><a id="submitting-new-entries">We are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> interested in straight technical terms
explained by textbooks or technical dictionaries unless an entry illuminates
‘underground’ meanings or aspects not covered by official
histories.  We are also not interested in ‘joke’ entries —
there is a lot of humor in the file but it must flow naturally out of the
explanations of what hackers do and how they think.</a></p><p><a id="submitting-new-entries">It is OK to submit items of jargon you have originated if they have
spread to the point of being used by people who are not personally acquainted
with you.  We prefer items to be attested by independent submission from two
different sites.</a></p><p><a id="submitting-new-entries">The Jargon File will be regularly maintained and made available for
browsing on the World Wide Web, and will include a version number.  Read it,
pass it around, contribute — this is <span class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span>
monument!</a></p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tbody><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/conventions.html">Prev</a>&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/pt01.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">&nbsp;<a accesskey="n" href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/lexicon.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter&nbsp;11.&nbsp;Other Lexicon Conventions&nbsp;</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">&nbsp;Part&nbsp;II.&nbsp;The Jargon Lexicon</td></tr></tbody></table></div><a id="submitting-new-entries">

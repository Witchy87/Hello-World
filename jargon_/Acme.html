   perfection or achievement] The canonical supplier of bizarre, elaborate,
   and non-functional gadgetry — where Rube Goldberg and Heath Robinson
   (two cartoonists who specialized in elaborate contraptions) shop.  The name
   has been humorously expanded as A (or American) Company Making Everything.
   (In fact, Acme was a real brand sold from Sears Roebuck catalogs in the
   early 1900s.)  Describing some X as an “<span class="quote">Acme X</span>” either means
   “<span class="quote">This is </span></a><a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/I/insanely-great.html"><i class="glossterm">insanely great</i></a>”, or, more
   likely, “<span class="quote">This looks <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/I/insanely-great.html"><i class="glossterm">insanely great</i></a> on paper,
   but in practice it's really easy to shoot yourself in the foot with
   it.</span>” Compare <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/P/pistol.html"><i class="glossterm">pistol</i></a>.</p></dd><dd><p>This term, specially cherished by American hackers and explained here
   for the benefit of our overseas brethren, comes from the Warner Brothers'
   series of “<span class="quote">Road-runner</span>” cartoons.  In these cartoons, the
   famished Wile E. Coyote was forever attempting to catch up with, trap, and
   eat the Road-runner.  His attempts usually involved one or more
   high-technology Rube Goldberg devices — rocket jetpacks, catapults,
   magnetic traps, high-powered slingshots, etc.  These were usually delivered
   in large wooden crates labeled prominently with the Acme name —
   which, probably not by coincidence, was the trade name of a peg bar system
   for superimposing animation cels used by cartoonists since forever. Acme
   devices invariably malfunctioned in improbable and violent ways.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tbody><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/A/ACK.html">Prev</a>�</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/A.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">�<a accesskey="n" href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/A/ad-hockery.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">ACK�</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">�ad-hockery</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

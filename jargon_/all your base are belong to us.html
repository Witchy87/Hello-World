The phrase stems from a
   1991 adaptation of Toaplan's “<span class="quote">Zero Wing</span>” shoot-'em-up arcade
   game for the Sega Genesis game console. A brief introduction was added to
   the opening screen, and it has what many consider to be the worst
   Japanese-to-English translation in video game history. The introduction
   shows the bridge of a starship in chaos as a Borg-like figure named CATS
   materializes and says, “<span class="quote">How are you gentlemen!!  All your base are
   belong to us.</span>” [sic] In 2001, this amusing mistranslation spread
   virally through the Internet, bringing with it a slew of JPEGs and a movie
   of hacked photographs, each showing a street sign, store front, package
   label, etc. hacked to read “<span class="quote">All your base are belong to us</span>” or
   one of the other many supremely dopey lines from the game (such as
   “<span class="quote">Somebody set up usthe bomb!!!</span>” or “<span class="quote">What
   happen?</span>”). When these phrases are used properly, the overall effect
   is both screamingly funny and somewhat chilling, reminiscent of the B movie
   “<span class="quote">They Live</span>”.</a></p><p><a id="all-your-base-are-belong-to-us">The original has been generalized to “<span class="quote">All your X are belong to
   us</span>”, where X is filled in to connote a sinister takeover of some
   sort.  Thus, “<span class="quote">When Joe signed up for his new job at Yoyodyne, he had
   to sign a draconian NDA. It basically said: All your code are belong to
   us.</span>” Has many of the connotations of “<span class="quote">Resistance is futile;
   you will be assimilated</span>” (see

   by the type of person that finds <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/J/Jeff-K-.html"><i class="glossterm">Jeff K.</i></a>
   hilarious.</p></dd><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tbody><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/A/All-hardware-sucks--all-software-sucks-.html">Prev</a>�</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/A.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right">�<a accesskey="n" href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/A/alpha-geek.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">All hardware sucks, all software sucks.�</td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">�alpha geek</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
